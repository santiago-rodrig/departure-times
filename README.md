### Introduction

This project is an API for fetching data about the departure times (obviously!)
of the public transport in a given bus stop, the data is being fetched from the
[NextBus API](https://www.nextbus.com/xmlFeedDocs/NextBusXMLFeed.pdf),

Right now, only one agency is being taken into account,
this agency is [San Francisco Muni](https://www.sfmta.com/). Actually, all the
public transport agencies that are in the North of California should be
handled, that's for a future version of the API.

### Live version and API documentation

The live version of the API has the following base URL.

`https://srodrig-departure-time-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/`

All the possible endpoints are explained in
[the documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11766934/TVCh1TUJ).
